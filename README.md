# codec-comparisons
This repo aims to accurately compare different codecs at the same bitrates. Currently it tests NVENC, QuickSync, and CPU encoding.

Refer to the "Default Comparisons" folder for a comparison focused on the default ffmpeg settings.

Refer to "Optimized Comparisons" for a comparison focused on optimized encoding settings per encoder.
